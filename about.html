        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Recycling Chatbot is a free educational tool designed for K‚Äì12 students. Recycling Chatbot generates ideas for hands-on projects using recyclable materials, such as cardboard or paper, to teach kids about sustainable engineering practices in an engaging way. Additionally, the chatbot sends links to Scratch programs that teach kids various principles, from the rules of recycling to food waste facts, through gamification. By using recyclable materials, we involve kids in STEM using items they can find at home, making our projects affordable and equitable to all.

        <h2>Our Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The STEM for Change Club presented our Recycling Chatbot to the New Jersey STEAM Tank Challenge (hosted by the NJ School Board Association), modeled after the hit show Shark Tank. After making it through the qualifying regional round, we were selected as one of the top 10 high school teams and won a $500 scholarship in the State Finals. We partnered with the Atlantic County Utilities Authority (ACUA) to make recycling easy and equitable for all. Our chatbot is now available to all students in Atlantic County, NJ, and beyond.
